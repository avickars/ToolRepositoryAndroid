# ToolRepositoryAndroid

This Android App was developed as a project to meet the needs of my own extended family.  I common problem that frequently occured was someone would need to borrow a tool from a family member, however one would have to waste a fairly significant amount of time one, seeing if someone had the tool, and two who currently had it.  So the purpose of this app is to bring every tool into a organized database, that includes who the what the tool actually is (and a variety of other information like the last time it was maintenanced), who owns it, and who currently has it.

## Brief Technical Aspects

The entire app is written in Java, and the backend is google's FireBase.

## Where this app currently stands

The is app is almost complete.  Expected completion date is after my midterms in June.  All that actually remains is making each individual tool clickable in the app to reveal a more detailed set of information of each tool.  However it will not be released privately onto the google play store until an identical IOS app has been completed (approximately half of the users will be on IOS, the other half on android).  The expected completion date of the IOS version is the end of August 2020.
